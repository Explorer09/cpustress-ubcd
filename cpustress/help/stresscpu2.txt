CPU stress tester 2.0 (-h for help)
Architecture: ia32/x86 (32bit)
Copyright (c) Erik Lindahl <lindahl@cbr.su.se> 2004-2007

This program accomplishes two things:

1. It heats your CPU by running hand-tuned SSE assembly
2. It checks the results to find memory and similar subtle errors

The actual code is a custom version of the GROMACS assembly loops.
Check out http://www.gromacs.org for details.

Available options:
 -h            Print this help message.
 -s            Completely silent execution (only print errors)
 -n #          Set # threads manually instead of automatically
 -t hh:mm:ss   Runtime

If an error occurs, executions stops with a string including 'ERROR'.

Passing options to stresscpu2 through the isolinux commandline
**************************************************************

If you want to run stresscpu2 with specific parameters, when you boot the
image, use something similar to:

    COM32  linux.c32 /ubcd/boot/cpustress/bzImage
    INITRD /ubcd/boot/cpustress/initrd.xz
    APPEND noapic ubcdcmd=stresscpu2 ubcdargs="-s -t 48:00:00"

The ubcdargs parameter contains the options that you want to pass to
stresscpu2.
