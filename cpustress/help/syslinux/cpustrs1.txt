The 0fCPUstress07 image is a minimal boot image for stress testing. It contains
these programs:  CPUburn, CPU Burn-in, CPUinfo, LINPACK, Mersenne Prime Test,
Sensors, Stress, StressCPU and Systester.

Other than testing, the image's functionality is little. It does not support
connection to the Internet or writing to disks.

Some test programs can be tweaked before running. Press 0f[TAB]07 to edit the boot
options in isolinux. The available tweaks are as follows.

For 0fCPU Burn-in07, you can specify the time it runs by using either '0fdays07',
'0fhours07', or '0fminutes07' option. By default, CPU Burn-in runs for 7 days
(=10080 minutes), which is equivalent to this:

> .com32 linux.c32 /ubcd/boot/cpustress/bzImage noapic quiet consoleblank=0
  ubcdcmd=cpuburn-in 0fdays=707 initrd=/ubcd/boot/cpustress/initrd.xz

If two or more time options are specified, the run time will be determined by
the value of larger unit (days > hours > minutes) and the rest are ignored.
