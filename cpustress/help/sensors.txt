NAME
       sensors - print sensors information

SYNOPSIS
       sensors [ options ] [ chips ]
       sensors -s [ chips ]
       sensors --bus-list

DESCRIPTION
       sensors is used to show the current readings of all sensor chips.
       sensors -s is used to set all limits as specified in the configuration
       file.
       sensors --bus-list is used to generate bus statements suitable for the
       configuration file.

OPTIONS
       -c, --config-file config-file
              Specify a configuration file. If no file is specified, the
              libsensors default configuration file is used. Use `-c /dev/null'
              to temporarily disable this default configuration file.

       -h, --help
              Print a help text and exit.

       -s, --set
              Evaluate all `set' statements in the configuration file and exit.
              You must be `root' to do this. If this parameter is not
              specified, no `set' statement is evaluated.

       -A, --no-adapter
              Do not show the adapter for each chip.

       -u     Raw output. This mode is only meant for debugging.

       -v, --version
              Print the program version and exit.

       -f, --fahrenheit
              Print the temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit instead of Celsius.

       --bus-list
              Generate bus statements suitable for using in sensors.conf. Such
              bus statements are only needed if you have several chips sharing
              the same address on different buses of the same type. As bus
              numbers are usually not guaranteed to be stable over reboots,
              these statements let you refer to each bus by its name rather
              than numbers.

FILES
       /etc/sensors3.conf
       /etc/sensors.conf
              The system wide configuration file. See sensors.conf(5) for
              further details.
