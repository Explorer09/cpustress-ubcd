This file documents the changes of CPUstress test from v2.1 to v2.2.
Changes are made by Explorer <explorer09@gmail.com>

8 April 2013

- Bug fixes regarding '--help' option in various scripts.

Changes in v2.2
---------------
6 April 2013

- Linux kernel updated to 3.8.6-cpustress. Build config is not changed.
- Minor documentation changes.

Changes in v2.2beta3
--------------------
2 April 2013

- Linux kernel is rebuilt (3.8.5-cpustress2), which fixes a bug below and adds 
  minor improvements.
- stress is rebuilt (same version), but with hard-disk stressing disabled.

Fixes:
- For some computers, the kernel might have detected only one CPU when ACPI
  support is disabled. (This happened on my Fujitsu laptop.) Now ACPI support 
  is added in the kernel.
- Fix the "Kernel args:" field output in the "/runonce" script.

Changes:
- The 'ubcdcmd' boot option now accepts dmesg, lsmod, and uname for debugging 
  use.
- Adds the 'modprobe' boot option allowing the user to load modules.

Changes in v2.2beta2
--------------------
31 March 2013

Updated programs:
- CPUstress now uses a kernel built by myself rather than the one from Parted 
  Magic. The custom kernel (3.8.5-cpustress) fixes two bugs below and is more 
  friendly to old processors (i486). It supports SMP but not PAE.
- eglibc updated to 2.17-r22665 (from 2.17-r22243).
- BusyBox is rebuilt (same version). Now "modprobe", "lsmod", and "uname" are 
  added.

Fixes:
- The "USB keyboard not found" bug due to missing drivers.
  (http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=14648)
- Regression that only 1 CPU can be detected.
  (http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=14646)
- Edited "help" and "helpinfo" scripts to fix a recursive calling bug.

Changes:
- The new eglibc now require Linux kernel 3.7.5 or above. (Parted Magic
  2013_01_29 has such kernel.)
- Add /etc/mdev.conf which allows loading modules on hotplug.

Notes:
- I do not test the lockup problem (http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/forums/
  viewtopic.php?t=3390) that happened in the old kernel, so I'm not sure 
  whether it was fixed or not. If anyone has the hardware and can test it, 
  then I appreciate for your help.
- Since Linux kernel 3.8, the i386 architecture is no longer supported. If you 
  have 80386 you'll probably need to build a 3.7.x Linux kernel.

Changes in v2.1expl7
--------------------
9 March 2013

- Changed "help" command into a wrapper script.
- Improved build scripts.
- Some cleanup to the code and documentation.
- Use INITRD directive in isolinux entries in the documentation.

Changes in v2.1expl6
--------------------
26 Feburary 2013

- Add help files that can be displayed in UBCD.
- The hint in "menu" no longer appears after running Stress.
- Support boot option 'cmdstresscpu2'. It works the same way as 'cmdstress', 
  allowing user to pass command-line switches from isolinux to the stresscpu2 
  program.

Changes in v2.1expl5.1
----------------------
9 Feburary 2013

- Use linux.c32 in the isolinux entries in the documentation. (Thanks to ady 
  for the suggestion.)
    COM32  linux.c32
    APPEND /pmagic/bzImage initrd=/ubcd/boot/cpustress/initrd.gz
           root=/dev/ram0 ramdisk_size=12000 noapic <other-parameters...>

Changes in v2.1expl5
--------------------
8 Feburary 2013

Updated programs:
- Updated Mersenne Prime Test to v27.9 build 1 (from 27.7 build 2).
- Updated eglibc to 2.17 (from 2.16.1).

Changes:
- Modifed the readme.txt to reflect the changes documented here.
- Changed the isolinux entries in various documentation and scripts. Since 
  UBCD 5.1, CPUstress should be booted using Parted Magic's kernel image. The 
  new entries are like this:
    KERNEL /pmagic/bzImage
    APPEND initrd=/ubcd/boot/cpustress/initrd.gz root=/dev/ram0 
           ramdisk_size=12000 noapic <other-parameters...>

Changes in v2.1expl4
--------------------
27 October 2012

- I re-downloaded and re-compiled eglibc and Busybox. The new binaries should 
  have some upstream bugs fixed.
- Fixed this bug more completely in cpuburn and mprime:

Changes in v2.1expl3
--------------------
9 September 2012

Updated programs:
- Updated Mersenne Prime test to v27.7 build 2 (from v24.14). Note that 
  v23.9.2 is still available for people who run Pentium III or older CPUs.
- Updated Stress to v1.0.4 (from v1.0.0)
- Updated Busybox to v1.20.2 (from v1.13.2)
- Updated ld-linux, libc, libm (part of eglibc) to v2.16 (from v2.8.90)
- Added libdl and libpthread (also part of eglibc) v2.16. These two files are 
  required for mprime27.

Fixes:
- Repacked ubcd/boot/cpustress/initrd.gz to cpio+gzip format. This prevents a 
  kernel panic when booting.
  (http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=6488)
- The version number of Mersenne Prime test 23 is actually 23.9.2. Fixed the 
  documentation bug in various scripts and help files.
- Add signal traps to terminate cpuburn-in or mprime when user terminates the 
  wrapper scripts via Ctrl+C (SIGINT) or Ctrl+\ (SIGQUIT).
  (http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=14429)
- Minor bug fixes in scripts.

Changes:
- Added "help" as an alias to "helpinfo" command.
- In "menu" the user can now type the command name as the choice rather than 
  number.
- Added a hint "Type 'menu' to return to main menu." in "menu".
- Use dynamically linked executable for mprime23, since the CPUstress image 
  have all the libraries it depends on already.
- Change the path in /lib/* symlinks from absolute to relative paths.

Below are the changes by Icecube, from v2.0 to v2.1.

(25 February 2009)

CPUstress image v2.1
* Updated kernel to v2.6.28.7
* Updated busybox to v1.13.2

* Corrected the 'FATAL ERROR: Writing to temp file' bug with mprime AGAIN.
It should work now with a 'infinite' number of CPUs, as long as you have 
enough RAM. It makes a temp directory with a size of 1/8 of your RAM. So 
mprime shouldn't complain with multi-core CPUS, unless you have a quad core 
with only 128MB of RAM, which is very unlikely :P.
* Display a countdown timer on the first screen.
* Changed the colors of colored text.
* Some cleanup of the code.

(2 December 2008)

Solved some bugs:
Mprime and CPUburn should work correctly with multicore CPUs ( 'Starting 
instance {1..2} of mprime' is corrected to 'Starting instance 1 of mprime' for 
the first instance of mprime and 'Starting instance 2 of mprime' for the 
second instance of mprime, etc.)

Corrected the 'FATAL ERROR: Writing to temp file' bug with mprime.

Updated busybox to 1.13.1.
