This file documents the changes of CPUstress test from v2.1 to v2.5.3.
Changes are made by Explorer <explorer09@gmail.com>

Changes in v2.5.3
-----------------
18 September 2014

- Updated kernel to 3.16.3. Disabled CONFIG_INTEL_IDLE as there are problems
  reported with the driver.
  (See http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=25464#p25464)
- Added "consoleblank=0" to boot parameters.
- Minor fixes in scripts and documentation.

Changes in v2.5.2
-----------------
7 September 2014

- Updated Intel LINPACK to v11.2.0 (from v11.1.3)
- Updated kernel to 3.16.2. Enabled CONFIG_RELOCATABLE due to recent change in
  the kernel code. See the Linux changelog for details.

Changes in v2.5.1
-----------------
20 August 2014

- Updated Mersenne Prime test to v28.5 build 2 (from v27.9 build 1)
- Minor fixes in scripts and documentation.

Changes in v2.5.0
-----------------
15 August 2014

Programs updated or rebuilt:
- Updated Intel LINPACK to v11.1.3 (from v11.1.2)
- Rebuilt systester-cli with GMP 6.0.0. Also GMP is now built as a fat binary.
- Rebuilt BusyBox and added 'mv' command.
- Updated libgcc to v4.9.1 (from v4.7.3)
- Updated kernel to 3.16.1.
- All programs and libraries (except cpuburn-in, linpack, and mprime) are re-
  compiled with a custom toolchain so that they are compatible with i486 CPUs.
  All CPUstress releases since v2.1expl3 and until this version are not really
  compatible with i486 and Pentium CPUs, due to the Ubuntu GCC that generates
  i686-only code. This regression is now fixed.
Changes:
- New wrapper script for Mersenne Prime test (mprime). This wrapper can now ask
  user for which type of torture test to run, and tune the torture test
  settings. Help document for mprime is also re-written.
- Various optimizations in shell scripts.

Changes in v2.4.0
-----------------
24 February 2014

Programs updated or rebuilt:
- Updated Intel LINPACK to v11.1.2 (from v11.1.1)
- Updated Sensors to v3.3.5 (from v3.3.4)
- Updated BusyBox to v1.22.1 (from v1.21.1)
- Updated eglibc to 2.19-r25243 (from 2.18-r24307)
- Updated kernel to 3.13.5. Config changes in this kernel build:
  1. No more CONFIG_IKCONFIG
  2. Block layer and ext2 filesystem support removed.
  3. Timer interrupt frequency is set to 100Hz (from 250Hz)
  4. Remove drivers of mouse and HID devices that are useless with cpustress.
Changes:
- Changed kernel and initrd compression from gzip to XZ. Build scripts and
  help documents are all updated to reflect this change. This makes the
  compressed kernel+initrd image 648KiB smaller, although the memory required
  for decompression increases from 600KiB to 800KiB.
- Use --ultra-brute switch in upx to re-compress linpack and mprime binaries.
  Also compress sensors, stress, stresscpu2, and systester-cli binaries.
Note:
- The older cpustress initrd files won't load with this new kernel.

Changes in v2.3.7
-----------------
22 November 2013

- Updated kernel to 3.12.1.
- Rebuilt eglibc (2.18-r24307).
- Updated Intel LINPACK to v11.1.1 (from v11.1.0)
- Patched and rebuilt stresscpu2 to accept '--help' option on the command-line.
- Rebuilt systester-cli with GMP 5.1.3.

Changes in v2.3.6
-----------------
15 September 2013

- Updated Intel LINPACK to v11.1.0 (from v11.0.5)
- Updated kernel to 3.11.1. Changes in this kernel build:
  1. Disable CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE
  2. Support x86 extended platforms (Intel MID, Medfield)
  3. Add hwmon drivers connected through SPI and IPMI
  4. Removed hwmon drivers that depend on Industrial I/O
  5. Removed I2C system bus drivers (for embedded)
- Updated eglibc to 2.18-r23929 (from 2.17-r23365). Also I removed several
  functions in this libc build, so the library is slightly smaller. See the
  compile note for details.
- Improvements to the build script. Root privilege or fakeroot is no longer
  needed to create initramfs image. Works with both GNU cpio and bsdcpio.
- Removed build-initrd/etc/modprobe.d
- Removed all trailing whitespace in scripts and documentation.
- Minor fixes in scripts and documentation.

Changes in v2.3.5
-----------------
20 July 2013

- Updated Intel LINPACK to v11.0.5 (from v11.0.3)
- stresscpu2 is rebuilt with dynamic linking.
- Patched and rebuilt systester-cli. See the compile note for the list of
  changes.
- Updated kernel to 3.10.1. Added drivers for keypads.
- Rebuilt eglibc (2.17-r23365).
- Updated BusyBox to v1.21.1 (from v1.21.0)

- Minor fixes in scripts and documentation.

Changes in v2.3.1
-----------------
20 April 2013

- Fix 'trap 1 2 3 15' bug in burn and cpuburn-m wrappers.

Changes in v2.3
---------------
19 April 2013

New programs:
- CPUburn v1.4a
- Intel Optimized LINPACK Benchmark 11.0.3
- System Stability Tester 1.5.1 (CLI version)
- Sensors v3.3.3

Programs updated or rebuilt:
- Updated kernel to 3.8.8. Added drivers of I2C buses and hardware sensors.
  Disabled loadable module support in kernel.
- BusyBox updated to 1.21.0. Added 'free', 'mpstat', 'ps', 'uptime', 'kill',
  'date', 'cp', and 'vi'. 'echo' now becomes ash built-in. Removed 'modprobe'
  and 'lsmod'.
- Added libgcc_s.so. This file is required by linpack.
- Rebuilt eglibc (same version).

Changes:
- Renamed 'cpuburn' wrapper to cpuburn-m.
- The cpuburn-m and mprime wrappers are now conservative when killing
  processes. (They now kill by PID rather than by name.) They now also reap
  zombie processes.
- Use "ubcdargs" instead of cmdhelpinfo, cmdstress, etc. in isolinux options.
- Other minor bug fixes.

Note:
- Please check your isolinux config files when you upgrade your CPUstress
  image to this version. There are 2 boot options incompatible with this new
  version:
  1. "ubcdcmd=cpuburn" no longer works. Use "ubcdcmd=cpuburn-in" instead.
  2. The options "cmdhelpinfo", "cmdstress", and "cmdstresscpu2" are obsolete.
     Use "ubcdargs" instead.

Changes in v2.2.1
-----------------
12 April 2013

Programs updated or rebuilt:
- CPU Burn-in now uses the binary from http://cpuburnin.com/. (It's mostly the
  same as the old one but the new binary uses the http://cpuburnin.com/ URL.)
- The mprime23 binary is now UPX-compressed.

Changes:
- Bug fixes regarding '--help' option in various scripts.
- Edit various shell scripts to improve compatibility to POSIX sh. Removed as
  many bashisms as possible.
- Removed "root=/dev/ram0 ramdisk_size=12000" from the isolinux command-line.
  Documentation is also updated for this. (Thanks to Icecube for the
  suggestion.)
- 'cpuburn' and 'mprime' script improvements. They now also trap signals 1
  and 15. 'mprime' now supports command-line arguments.

Changes in v2.2
---------------
6 April 2013

- Linux kernel updated to 3.8.6-cpustress. Build config is not changed.
- Minor documentation changes.

Changes in v2.2beta3
--------------------
2 April 2013

- Linux kernel is rebuilt (3.8.5-cpustress2), which fixes a bug below and adds
  minor improvements.
- stress is rebuilt (same version), but with hard-disk stressing disabled.

Fixes:
- For some computers, the kernel might have detected only one CPU when ACPI
  support is disabled. (This happened on my Fujitsu laptop.) Now ACPI support
  is added in the kernel.
- Fix the "Kernel args:" field output in the "/runonce" script.

Changes:
- The 'ubcdcmd' boot option now accepts dmesg, lsmod, and uname for debugging
  use.
- Adds the 'modprobe' boot option allowing the user to load modules.

Changes in v2.2beta2
--------------------
31 March 2013

Updated programs:
- CPUstress now uses a kernel built by myself rather than the one from Parted
  Magic. The custom kernel (3.8.5-cpustress) fixes two bugs below and is more
  friendly to old processors (i486). It supports SMP but not PAE.
- eglibc updated to 2.17-r22665 (from 2.17-r22243).
- BusyBox is rebuilt (same version). Now "modprobe", "lsmod", and "uname" are
  added.

Fixes:
- The "USB keyboard not found" bug due to missing drivers.
  (http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=14648)
- Regression that only 1 CPU can be detected.
  (http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=14646)
- Edited "help" and "helpinfo" scripts to fix a recursive calling bug.

Changes:
- The new eglibc now require Linux kernel 3.7.5 or above. (Parted Magic
  2013_01_29 has such kernel.)
- Add /etc/mdev.conf which allows loading modules on hotplug.

Notes:
- I do not test the lockup problem (http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/forums/
  viewtopic.php?t=3390) that happened in the old kernel, so I'm not sure
  whether it was fixed or not. If anyone has the hardware and can test it,
  then I appreciate for your help.
- Since Linux kernel 3.8, the i386 architecture is no longer supported. If you
  have a 80386 you need to upgrade. (Even though you can build a Linux kernel
  for it, the C library (glibc) doesn't support i386. So it won't work.)

Changes in v2.1expl7
--------------------
9 March 2013

- Changed "help" command into a wrapper script.
- Improved build scripts.
- Some cleanup to the code and documentation.
- Use INITRD directive in isolinux entries in the documentation.

Changes in v2.1expl6
--------------------
26 Feburary 2013

- Add help files that can be displayed in UBCD.
- The hint in "menu" no longer appears after running Stress.
- Support boot option 'cmdstresscpu2'. It works the same way as 'cmdstress',
  allowing user to pass command-line switches from isolinux to the stresscpu2
  program.

Changes in v2.1expl5.1
----------------------
9 Feburary 2013

- Use linux.c32 in the isolinux entries in the documentation. (Thanks to ady
  for the suggestion.)
    COM32  linux.c32
    APPEND /pmagic/bzImage initrd=/ubcd/boot/cpustress/initrd.gz
           root=/dev/ram0 ramdisk_size=12000 noapic <other-parameters...>

Changes in v2.1expl5
--------------------
8 Feburary 2013

Updated programs:
- Updated Mersenne Prime Test to v27.9 build 1 (from 27.7 build 2).
- Updated eglibc to 2.17 (from 2.16.1).

Changes:
- Modified the readme.txt to reflect the changes documented here.
- Changed the isolinux entries in various documentation and scripts. Since
  UBCD 5.1, CPUstress should be booted using Parted Magic's kernel image. The
  new entries are like this:
    KERNEL /pmagic/bzImage
    APPEND initrd=/ubcd/boot/cpustress/initrd.gz root=/dev/ram0
           ramdisk_size=12000 noapic <other-parameters...>

Changes in v2.1expl4
--------------------
27 October 2012

- I re-downloaded and re-compiled eglibc and Busybox. The new binaries should
  have some upstream bugs fixed.
- Fixed this bug more completely in cpuburn and mprime:
  http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=14429

Changes in v2.1expl3
--------------------
9 September 2012

Updated programs:
- Updated Mersenne Prime test to v27.7 build 2 (from v24.14). Note that
  v23.9.2 is still available for people who run Pentium III or older CPUs.
- Updated Stress to v1.0.4 (from v1.0.0)
- Updated Busybox to v1.20.2 (from v1.13.2)
- Updated ld-linux, libc, libm (part of eglibc) to v2.16 (from v2.8.90)
- Added libdl and libpthread (also part of eglibc) v2.16. These two files are
  required for mprime27.

Fixes:
- Repacked ubcd/boot/cpustress/initrd.gz to cpio+gzip format. This prevents a
  kernel panic when booting.
  (http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=6488)
- The version number of Mersenne Prime test 23 is actually 23.9.2. Fixed the
  documentation bug in various scripts and help files.
- Add signal traps to terminate cpuburn-in or mprime when user terminates the
  wrapper scripts via Ctrl+C (SIGINT) or Ctrl+\ (SIGQUIT).
  (http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=14429)
- Minor bug fixes in scripts.

Changes:
- Added "help" as an alias to "helpinfo" command.
- In "menu" the user can now type the command name as the choice rather than
  number.
- Added a hint "Type 'menu' to return to main menu." in "menu".
- Use dynamically linked executable for mprime23, since the CPUstress image
  have all the libraries it depends on already.
- Change the path in /lib/* symlinks from absolute to relative paths.

Below are the changes by Icecube, from v2.0 to v2.1.
----------------------------------------------------

(25 February 2009)

CPUstress image v2.1
* Updated kernel to v2.6.28.7
* Updated busybox to v1.13.2

* Corrected the 'FATAL ERROR: Writing to temp file' bug with mprime AGAIN.
It should work now with a 'infinite' number of CPUs, as long as you have
enough RAM. It makes a temp directory with a size of 1/8 of your RAM. So
mprime shouldn't complain with multi-core CPUS, unless you have a quad core
with only 128MB of RAM, which is very unlikely :P.
* Display a countdown timer on the first screen.
* Changed the colors of colored text.
* Some cleanup of the code.

(2 December 2008)

Solved some bugs:
Mprime and CPUburn should work correctly with multicore CPUs ( 'Starting
instance {1..2} of mprime' is corrected to 'Starting instance 1 of mprime' for
the first instance of mprime and 'Starting instance 2 of mprime' for the
second instance of mprime, etc.)

Corrected the 'FATAL ERROR: Writing to temp file' bug with mprime.

Updated busybox to 1.13.1.
