This CPUstress image contains non-free programs, and programs not compatible
with GNU GPL. When you distribute this image, you have to inform the users
about these non-free components, because the image as a whole cannot be
distributed under GPL without modification.

Below is the list of programs that are either non-free (i.e. not "free as in
freedom") or are under a license incompatible with GPL. If you wish to
distribute an image that is free software only, this document shows you what
files you need to remove in order to do so.

All paths are relative to the "build-initrd" directory, or the root directory
of the extracted initrd image.

* CPU Burn-in - This program is a closed-source freeware.
  Files: opt/cpuburn-in/*
         usr/local/bin/cpuburn-in
         usr/local/bin/cpuburn-m

* Intel Optimized LINPACK Benchmark - This program is a closed-source freeware.
  Files: opt/linpack/*
         usr/local/bin/linpack

* Mersenne Prime test - This program is under an (almost) permissive license
  that is incompatible with GPL. Specifically, the license has a requirement
  that if the user finds a prime number using the program he must credit GIMPS
  as the discoverer and may not claim prizes on his own. It is technically not
  free software for this reason.
  Files: opt/mprime/*
         usr/local/bin/mprime

After removing the files, you should consider editing the menus and
documentation to reflect the changes. Below is the list of files you may need
to edit. (Inside "build-initrd")
