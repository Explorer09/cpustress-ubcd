The Linux kernel for CPUstress is compiled on Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS (32-bit), with
a custom cross-toolchain described in "toolchain.txt". Before compiling, make
sure you have the toolchain built already and the PATH variable containing the
'bin' directory of the toolchain:

 $ export PATH="${TOOLS_DIR}/bin:${PATH}"

The source code of the kernel is from the official kernel.org site. No
additional patch is applied.

Download the source code and then prepare the source directory for building:

 $ wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.x/linux-3.15.9.tar.xz
 $ tar -x -v --xz -f linux-3.15.9.tar.xz
 $ cd linux-3.15.9
 $ make mrproper

Copy the "config-3.15-cpustress" file into the source code directory, then
rename it:

 $ mv config-3.15-cpustress .config

Build the kernel, if you don't want to configure anything else:

 $ make CROSS_COMPILE="i486-pc-linux-gnu-" oldconfig
 $ make CROSS_COMPILE="i486-pc-linux-gnu-"

Copy the kernel bzImage, which is located at "arch/x86/boot/bzImage", to a
directory that you can boot from. For example in UBCD it's
"${ubcd_extract}/ubcd/boot/cpustress/bzImage".

 $ cp -a arch/x86/boot/bzImage "${ubcd_extract}/ubcd/boot/cpustress/bzImage"
