The cpuburn-in program included in the image is the official binary from
cpuburnin.com, which can be downloaded here:
    http://cpuburnin.com/downloads/cpuburn-in.tar.gz

After downloading, you can strip the binary file to save a few bytes. I did so 
in my CPUstress image.

 $ strip cpuburn-in

CPU Burn-in is not open-source.
