The cpuburn-in program included in the image is the official binary from
cpuburnin.com, which can be downloaded here:
http://cpuburnin.com/downloads/cpuburn-in.tar.gz

After downloading, make sure you unpack it to an EMPTY directory. The archive
does not have a top-level directory like most other source packages do, so
EXISTING FILES MIGHT GET OVERWRITTEN if the directory is not empty.

 $ mkdir cpuburn-in
 $ cd cpuburn-in
 $ tar -x -v -z -f ../cpuburn-in.tar.gz

The mode of the cpuburn-in binary after unpacking is 644, change it to 755:

 $ chmod 755 cpuburn-in

(Optional) You can strip the binary file to save a few bytes. I did so in my
CPUstress image: (The strip tool is from the cross-toolchain described in
"toolchain.txt")

 $ export PATH="${TOOLS_DIR}/bin:${PATH}"
 $ i486-pc-linux-gnu-strip cpuburn-in

CPU Burn-in is a closed-source program.
