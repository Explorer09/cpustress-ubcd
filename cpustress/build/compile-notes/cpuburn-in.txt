The cpuburn-in program included in the image is the official binary from
cpuburnin.com, which can be downloaded here:
    http://cpuburnin.com/downloads/cpuburn-in.tar.gz

After downloading, make sure you unpack it to an empty directory. (You don't
want your files to be replaced, do you?)

 $ tar -x -v -z -f cpuburn-in.tar.gz

The mode of the cpuburn-in binary after unpacking is 644, change it to 755:

 $ chmod 755 cpuburn-in

(Optional) You can strip the binary file to save a few bytes. I did so in my
CPUstress image.

 $ strip cpuburn-in

CPU Burn-in is a closed-source program.
