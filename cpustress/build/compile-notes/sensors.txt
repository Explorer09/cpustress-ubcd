lm-sensors website:
http://lm-sensors.org/

The 'sensors' program is compiled on Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS (64-bit), with a custom
cross-toolchain described in "toolchain.txt". Before compiling, make sure you
have the toolchain built already and the PATH variable containing the 'bin'
directory of the toolchain:

 $ export PATH="${TOOLS_DIR}/bin:${PATH}"

In addition to the build-essential tools, you also need Bison and Flex.
Install these in Ubuntu:

 $ sudo apt-get install bison flex

Download and unpack the code:

 $ wget http://dl.lm-sensors.org/lm-sensors/releases/lm_sensors-3.4.0.tar.bz2
 $ tar -x -v --bzip2 -f lm_sensors-3.4.0.tar.bz2
 $ cd lm_sensors-3.4.0

Originally lm-sensors will produce 'libsensors.so' shared library and the
'sensors' program that depends on it. We don't need the whole library when only
one program needs it. So I edit the linker flags in the makefile:

 $ sed -i.bak -e 's/-Llib -lsensors/-Llib -l:libsensors.a -lc -lm/' \
     prog/sensors/Module.mk

This forces the linker to link to the static 'libsensors.a'.
Build the code:

 $ make CC=i486-pc-linux-gnu-gcc CFLAGS='-flto' AR=i486-pc-linux-gnu-ar

Note:
* This build enables Link Time Optimization (-flto) from gcc to produce a
  smaller binary.

Install lm-sensors to a temporary directory (for example "lm-sensors-install"):

 $ make DESTDIR="${HOME}/lm-sensors-install" install

In the temporary directory, we need only these files in the CPUstress image:
    etc/sensors3.conf, usr/local/bin/sensors
The other files are either not needed at the time of this writing, or they
require command interpreters (Bash or Perl) that CPUstress doesn't have.

Copy the files: (Replace ${cpustress_initrd} with the root path of your
extracted initrd image.)

 $ cd ${HOME}/lm-sensors-install
 $ cp -a "etc/sensors3.conf"     "${cpustress_initrd}/etc/sensors3.conf"
 $ cp -a "usr/local/bin/sensors" "${cpustress_initrd}/usr/local/bin/sensors"

(Optional) The help text of 'sensors' is copied from the man page in the temp
directory at "usr/local/man/man1/sensors.1". It is viewed in a terminal window
that is 82-column wide. The 'man' command is invoked like this:

 $ man --no-hyphenation --no-justification usr/local/man/man1/sensors.1

(Optional) To reduce the file size, I stripped the binaries after compilation:

 $ cd ${cpustress_initrd}/usr/local/bin
 $ strip sensors

(Optional) I also used UPX to compress the executable so the file size could
be much smaller: <http://upx.sourceforge.net/>

 $ upx --ultra-brute sensors

The program depends on these libraries:
    libc.so.6
    libm.so.6
    /lib/ld-linux.so.2
