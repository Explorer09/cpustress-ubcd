EGLIBC is compiled on Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS (32-bit), with a custom cross-
toolchain described in "toolchain.txt". The library must now be built together
with the cross-toolchain, so read "toolchain.txt" for build instructions.
This document shows some additional information when building EGLIBC.

Dependencies. You need SVN client to fetch out the EGLIBC source code and Gawk
for the configure script to work (Ubuntu ships with mawk which doesn't work).
Autoconf, Gettext, and Texinfo are not strictly necessary but 'configure' will
generate warnings if you don't have them.

 $ sudo apt-get install subversion gawk autoconf gettext texinfo

The "option-groups.config" file disables various functions in order to make the
library smaller and build process faster. The option groups is one of the
reasons that CPUstress has to use EGLIBC rather than glibc at the moment.

******************************************************************************
NOTICE: The C library included in CPUstress is a REDUCED build. It does not
contain every function that you may find in the normal glibc. When adding a
new program to CPUstress, make sure that the library provides the functions
you need. You may use the 'ldd' utility to check library dependencies and
'readelf --dyn-syms' to list the symbols available in libc.so and what are
needed by your program.

If you are not sure, recompile the library without the "option-groups.config"
file.
******************************************************************************

Notes about the configure options:
* If you want to make the library compatible with the old CPUstress kernel
  from Icecube, set "--enable-kernel=2.6.28" instead of "2.6.36".
  Setting any version higher than 2.6.36 optimizes nothing in the code, but it
  makes your library less compatible.
* Currently EGLIBC comes with NPTL and libidn add-ons. Only NPTL is needed by
  CPUstress.

CPUstress image needs only 6 '.so' files from the build directory. Namely:
   elf/ld.so           (ld-2.19.so           ld-linux.so.2    )
   libc.so             (libc-2.19.so         libc.so.6        )
   dlfcn/libdl.so      (libdl-2.19.so        libdl.so.2       )
   math/libm.so        (libm-2.19.so         libm.so.6        )
   nss/libnss_files.so (libnss_files-2.19.so libnss_files.so.2)
   nptl/libpthread.so  (libpthread-2.19.so   libpthread.so.0  )

Only 3 '.so' files in glibc are actually executable. They are ld.so, libc.so,
and libpthread.so, the rest of the '.so' files will 'Segmentation fault' when
being executed, and so their execution bit should be removed. (Mode bit should
be 644 not 755.) Ubuntu does this in its system libraries.

The precompiled libraries in CPUstress were compiled with different
"enable-kernel" switches. Although this is unnecessary and time-consuming, I
did this to minimize the version requirements of the individual file, while
keeping the code optimized for the latest kernel. The switches are as follows:
   libdl.so, libm.so: --enable-kernel=2.6.16
   libnss_files.so:   --enable-kernel=2.6.23
   libpthread.so:     --enable-kernel=2.6.29
   ld.so, libc.so:    --enable-kernel=2.6.36
