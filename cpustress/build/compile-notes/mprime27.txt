The mprime27 program included in the image is the official binary, which can 
be downloaded here:
    ftp://mersenne.org/gimps/p95v279.linux32.tar.gz
or here:
    http://mersenneforum.org/gimps/p95v279.linux32.tar.gz

After downloading, you can strip the binary file to save a few bytes. I did so 
in my CPUstress image.

 $ mv mprime mprime27
 $ strip mprime27

I also used UPX to compress the executable so the file size could be much 
smaller:
 $ upx mprime27

This program depends on these libraies:
    libm.so.6
    libpthread.so.0
    libdl.so.2
    libc.so.6
    /lib/ld-linux.so.2

Unfortunately I can't build a static version from source, so these libraries 
have to be carried to the CPUstress image.
