The mprime27 program included in the image is the official binary, which can 
be downloaded here:
    ftp://mersenne.org/gimps/p95v279.linux32.tar.gz
or here:
    http://mersenneforum.org/gimps/p95v279.linux32.tar.gz

After downloading, rename the executable to mprime23:

 $ mv mprime mprime27

(Optional) You can strip the binary file to save a few bytes. I did so in my 
CPUstress image:

 $ strip mprime27

(Optional) I also used UPX to compress the executable so the file size could 
be much smaller:

 $ upx mprime27

(Optional)

 $ chmod 775 mprime27

This program depends on these libraies:
    libm.so.6
    libpthread.so.0
    libdl.so.2
    libc.so.6
    /lib/ld-linux.so.2

Unfortunately I can't build a static version from source, so these libraries 
have to be carried to the CPUstress image.
