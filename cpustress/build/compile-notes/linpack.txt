The Intel Optimized LINPACK Benchmark can be downloaded here:
http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-math-kernel-library-linpack-download

Direct link:
http://registrationcenter.intel.com/irc_nas/3234/l_lpk_p_11.0.5.009.tgz

 $ tar -x -v -z -f l_lpk_p_11.0.5.009.tgz

After unpacking the archive, you will find the binaries of Intel LINPACK at
this directory: "linpack_11.0.5/benchmarks/linpack"

 $ cd linpack_11.0.5/benchmarks/linpack

We need only these files:
    help.lpk and xhelp.lpk (help files)
    lininput_xeon32 (sample input config file)
    xlinpack_xeon32 (32-bit executable)

All of these files were in mode 755. Change them:

 $ chmod 644 help.lpk xhelp.lpk lininput_xeon32
 $ chmod 755 xlinpack_xeon32

Note: Don't rename help.lpk or xhelp.lpk as xlinpack_xeon32 reads these files
for displaying its help text.

(Optional) You can strip the binary file to save a few bytes. I did so in my
CPUstress image:

 $ strip xlinpack_xeon32

(Optional) I also used UPX to compress the executable so the file size could
be much smaller: <http://upx.sourceforge.net/>

 $ upx xlinpack_xeon32

The program depends on these libraries:
    libpthread.so.0
    libm.so.6
    libgcc_s.so.1
    libc.so.6
    /lib/ld-linux.so.2
    libdl.so.2
