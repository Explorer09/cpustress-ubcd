StressCPU2 can be downloaded here:
http://www.gromacs.org/@api/deki/files/43/=stresscpu2.tgz

The StressCPU2 binary included in CPUstress is compiled on Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS
(32-bit), with a custom cross-toolchain described in "toolchain.txt". Before
compiling, make sure you have the toolchain built already and the PATH variable
containing the 'bin' directory of the toolchain:

 $ export PATH="${TOOLS_DIR}/bin:${PATH}"

The precompiled binaries in the StressCPU2 package is statically linked. But I
prefer dynamically linked version because it is smaller.

After downloading and unpacking, apply a patch that lets StressCPU2 accept the
'--help' command-line option:

 $ cd stresscpu2
 $ patch -p 1 <stresscpu2-long-help-option.patch

Then build the dynamically linked binary from source:

 $ sed -e 's/-static//' -e 's/^\tcc/\t$(CC)/' <Makefile.Linux32 >Makefile
 $ make CC=i486-pc-linux-gnu-gcc LDFLAGS='-static-libgcc' \
     CFLAGS='-O3 -flto -march=pentium3 -mtune=generic'

Note:
* This build enables Link Time Optimization (-flto) from gcc to produce a
  smaller binary. However the LTO'd binary will unnecessarily depend on
  libgcc_s.so, therefore -static-libgcc is specified to avoid it.

(Optional) Change the mode of the binary:

 $ chmod 755 stresscpu2

(Optional) To reduce the file size, I stripped the binary after compilation:

 $ strip stresscpu2

(Optional) I also used UPX to compress the executable so the file size could
be much smaller: <http://upx.sourceforge.net/>

 $ upx --ultra-brute stresscpu2

The program depends on these libraries:
    libpthread.so.0
    libc.so.6
    /lib/ld-linux.so.2

Additional note:

According to my experiment, the original binary "stresscpu2_linux32" is likely
to be compiled on CentOS 4.4 (i386) without any post-release update.
The toolchain was as follows:
   GNU libc version 2.3.4-2.25
   GNU Binutils version 2.15.92.0.2-21 20040927
   GCC version 3.4.6 20060404 (Red Hat 3.4.6-3)
I didn't contact the author for this so I might be wrong. But at least I get
the identical executable when compiling there.
