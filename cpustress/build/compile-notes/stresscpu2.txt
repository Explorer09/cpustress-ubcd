StressCPU2 can be downloaded here:
http://www.gromacs.org/@api/deki/files/43/=stresscpu2.tgz

The stresscpu2 binary included in CPUstress is compiled on Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS 
(32-bit).

The precompiled binaries in the stresscpu2 package is statically linked. But I 
prefer dynamically linked version because it is smaller.

After downloading and unpacking, build the dynamically linked binary from 
source:

 $ cd stresscpu2
 $ sed -e 's/-static//' <Makefile.Linux32 >Makefile
 $ make

(Optional) Change the mode of the binary:

 $ chmod 755 stresscpu2

(Optional) To reduce the file size, I stripped the binary after compilation:

 $ strip stresscpu2

Additional note:
According to my experiment, the original binary "stresscpu2_linux32" is likely 
to be compiled on CentOS 4.4 (i386) without any post-release update.
The toolchain was as follows:
   GNU libc version 2.3.4-2.25
   GNU Binutils version 2.15.92.0.2-21 20040927
   GCC version 3.4.6 20060404 (Red Hat 3.4.6-3)
I didn't contact the author for this so I might be wrong. But at least I get 
the identical executable when compiling there.
