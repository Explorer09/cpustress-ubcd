The stresscpu2 program included in the CPUstress image in the official binary.

stresscpu2 can be downloaded here:
http://www.gromacs.org/@api/deki/files/43/=stresscpu2.tgz

After downloading and unpacking, rename the executable:

 $ cd stresscpu2
 $ mv stresscpu2_linux32 stresscpu2

(Optional) Change the mode of the binary:

 $ chmod 775 stresscpu2

(Optional) You can strip the binary file to save a few bytes. I did so in my 
CPUstress image:

 $ strip stresscpu2
