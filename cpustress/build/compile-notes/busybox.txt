The BusyBox source code and the official patches can be downloaded here:
http://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.21.1.tar.bz2
(At the time of the writing, there were no official patches for 1.21.1. You 
can check the official patches at 
<http://busybox.net/downloads/fixes-1.21.1/>.)

The BusyBox binary is compiled on Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS (32-bit).

After downloading and unpacking the source code, copy the file "config" and 
the ".patch" files into the source code directory. Then apply the patches and 
the config:

 $ cd busybox-1.21.1
 $ mv config .config

Finally, build BusyBox:

 $ make
 $ make install

The binary will be ready in a directory named "_install" inside the busybox 
source, as well as the necessary symlinks.
