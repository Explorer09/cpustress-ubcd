Homepage of cpuburn by Robert Redelmeier:

The cpuburn source code can be downloaded here:
http://web.archive.org/web/20110110021132/http://pages.sbcglobal.net/redelm/cpuburn_1_4a_tar.gz

The original website <http://pages.sbcglobal.net/redelm/> is dead, so the code
have to be downloaded from a mirror.

Unpack and build the code:

 $ tar -x -v -z -f cpuburn_1_4a_tar.gz
 $ cd cpuburn-1.4a
 $ make

(The source code is written in assembly language, so there is little for you to
configure. Even so I build this with a custom cross-toolchain described in
"toolchain.txt", and before running 'make' I edited Makefile to use
i486-pc-linux-gnu-gcc instead.)

(Optional) Change the mode of the binaries:

 $ chmod 755 burnP5 burnP6 burnK6 burnK7 burnBX burnMMX

Copy the executables and that's it:

 $ cp -a burnP5 burnP6 burnK6 burnK7 burnBX burnMMX \
         ${cpustress_initrd}/opt/burn
