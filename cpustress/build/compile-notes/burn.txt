The cpuburn source code can be downloaded here:
http://web.archive.org/web/20110110021132/http://pages.sbcglobal.net/redelm/cpuburn_1_4a_tar.gz

The original website <http://pages.sbcglobal.net/redelm/> is dead, so the code 
have to be downloaded from a mirror.

Unpack and build the code:

 $ tar -x -v -z -f cpuburn_1_4a_tar.gz
 $ cd cpuburn-1.4a
 $ make

Copy the executables:

 $ cp -a burnP5 burnP6 burnK6 burnK7 burnBX burnMMX ${cpustress}/opt/burn

That's it. Because the code is written in assembly language there is nothing 
for you to configure.
