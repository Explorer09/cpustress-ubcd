Website of the Mersenne Prime test program (a.k.a. mprime or prime95):
http://www.mersenne.org/download/

The mprime programs included in the CPUstress image are official binaries.
Both are dynamically linked versions (not static).

Below are direct download links:
mprime v23.9
ftp://www.mersenne.org/gimps_archive/archived_executables/mprime239.tar.gz
mprime v27.9 (there may be other mirrors)
ftp://mersenne.org/gimps/p95v279.linux32.tar.gz
http://mersenneforum.org/gimps/p95v279.linux32.tar.gz

After downloading, make sure you unpack them to 2 separate empty directories,
such as 'mprime239' and 'p95v279'. (You don't want your files to be replaced,
do you?)

(Optional) Change the mode of the binaries:

 $ chmod 755 mprime239/mprime
 $ chmod 755 p95v279/mprime

(Optional) You can strip the binary file to save a few bytes. I did so in my
CPUstress image:

 $ strip mprime239/mprime
 $ strip p95v279/mprime

(Optional) I also used UPX to compress the executable so the file size could
be much smaller: <http://upx.sourceforge.net/>

 $ upx --ultra-brute mprime239/mprime
 $ upx --ultra-brute p95v279/mprime

The programs depend on these libraries:
    libm.so.6
    libpthread.so.0 (mprime27 only)
    libdl.so.2 (mprime27 only)
    libc.so.6
    /lib/ld-linux.so.2

Note that the mprime wrapper script in the CPUstress image depends on the hand-
written prime.ini or prime.txt to work, so don't delete the files or edit their
contents. (The comments in the INI are there for a reason.)
