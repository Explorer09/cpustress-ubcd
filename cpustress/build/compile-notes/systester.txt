Systester download page:
  http://systester.sourceforge.net/downloads.php

Systester is compiled on Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS (32-bit).

It requires GMP library in order to build. You can download GMP form the 
website <http://gmplib.org/> or use the direct link below.

For the shell commands below, I assume that you would unpack GMP at the home 
directory, but you may change the path if you like. 

 $ cd $HOME
 $ wget ftp://ftp.gmplib.org/pub/gmp/gmp-5.1.1.tar.xz
 $ tar -x -v --xz -f gmp-5.1.1.tar.xz
 $ cd gmp-5.1.1

Configure and build GMP:

 $ ./configure --disable-shared ABI=32 \
     CFLAGS='-m32 -O2 -pedantic -fomit-frame-pointer'
 $ make

Notes about the configure options:
* The configure script of GMP would try to produce the binary optimized to the 
  build system. (With CFLAGS='-march=<your_arch>') This would make the binary 
  non-portable. Thus, I overwrite CFLAGS so that '-mtune' and '-march' are 
  not used. The CFLAGS specified here are the same as the systester compiled 
  in Parted Magic.
* If you have a 64-bit processor, the configure script might set the build 
  system to 64-bit (even though the OS is 32-bit). With the overwritten CFLAGS 
  this will generate en error. "ABI=32" solves this.

Unpack and build Systester (CLI version):

 $ tar -x -v -z -f systester-1.5.1.tar.gz
 $ cd systester-1.5.1/cli
 $ CPPFLAGS='-L${HOME}/gmp-5.1.1/.libs -I${HOME}/gmp-5.1.1' make cli

(Optional) To reduce the file size, I stripped the binary after compilation:

 $ strip systester-cli
