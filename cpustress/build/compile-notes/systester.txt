Systester download page:
http://systester.sourceforge.net/downloads.php

Systester is compiled on Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS (32-bit).

It requires GMP library in order to build. You can download GMP form the
website <http://gmplib.org/> or use the direct link below.

For the shell commands below, I assume that you would unpack GMP at the home
directory, but you may change the path if you like.

 $ cd ${HOME}
 $ wget ftp://ftp.gmplib.org/pub/gmp/gmp-5.1.2.tar.xz
 $ tar -x -v --xz -f gmp-5.1.2.tar.xz
 $ cd gmp-5.1.2

Configure and build GMP:

 $ ./configure --build=i386-pc-linux-gnu --disable-shared ABI=32 \
     CFLAGS='-m32 -O2 -pedantic -fomit-frame-pointer'
 $ make

Notes about the configure options:
* The configure script of GMP would try to produce the binary optimized to the
  build system. (With CFLAGS='-march=<your_arch>') This would make the binary
  un-portable. Thus, I overwrite CFLAGS so that '-mtune' and '-march' are not
  used. The CFLAGS specified here are the same as the systester compiled in
  Parted Magic.
* The "--build=i386-pc-linux-gnu" option forces GMP to include a generic
  header (gmp-mparam.h) instead of a header optimized for a particular
  architecture.
* If you have a 64-bit processor, the configure script might set the build
  system to 64-bit (even though the OS is 32-bit). With the overwritten CFLAGS
  this will generate an error, unless you also specify "ABI=32".

Unpack Systester:

 $ cd ${HOME}
 $ tar -x -v -z -f systester-1.5.1.tar.gz

Copy the ".patch" files into the source code directory. Then apply the patches:

 $ cd systester-1.5.1
 $ patch -p 1 <systester-cli-changes.patch
 $ patch -p 1 <systester-column-align.patch
 $ patch -p 1 <systester-gui-64-threads.patch
 $ patch -p 1 <systester-log-file-format.patch

Build Systester (CLI version):

 $ cd cli
 $ CPPFLAGS='-L${HOME}/gmp-5.1.2/.libs -I${HOME}/gmp-5.1.2' make cli

(Optional) Change the mode of the binary:

 $ chmod 755 stresscpu2

(Optional) To reduce the file size, I stripped the binary after compilation:

 $ strip systester-cli
