Homepage of stress by Amos Waterland:

The source code of stress can be downloaded here:
http://web.archive.org/web/20130116202706/http://weather.ou.edu/~apw/projects/stress/stress-1.0.4.tar.gz

The original website <http://weather.ou.edu/~apw/projects/stress/> is dead, so
the code have to be downloaded from a mirror.

The stress binary is compiled on Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS (32-bit).

After downloading and unpacking the source code, apply a patch to disable the
hdd stressing, because the CPUstress image does not support writing to disks:

 $ cd stress-1.0.4
 $ patch -p 1 <stress-no-hdd.patch

Then run the configure script and then "make". You will get the binary in the
"src" directory.

 $ ./configure
 $ make

(Optional) To reduce the file size, I stripped the binary after compilation:

 $ strip ./src/stress

(Optional) I also used UPX to compress the executable so the file size could
be much smaller: <http://upx.sourceforge.net/>

 $ upx --ultra-brute ./src/stress

The program depends on these libraries:
    libm.so.6
    libc.so.6
    /lib/ld-linux.so.2
