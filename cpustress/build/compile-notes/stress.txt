The source code of stress can be downloaded here:
http://weather.ou.edu/~apw/projects/stress/stress-1.0.4.tar.gz

The stress binary is compiled on Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS (32-bit).

After downloading and unpacking the source code, apply a patch to disable the 
hdd stressing, because the CPUstress image does not support writing to disks:

 $ cd stress-1.0.4
 $ patch -p 1 <stress-no-hdd.patch

Then run the configure script and then "make". You will get the binary in the 
"src" directory. (The default settings by configure should be enough for the 
CPUstress image.)

 $ ./configure
 $ make

I stripped the binary after compilation to reduce the file size.

 $ strip ./src/stress
