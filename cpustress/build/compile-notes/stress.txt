The source code of stress can be downloaded here:
http://web.archive.org/web/20130116202706/http://weather.ou.edu/~apw/projects/stress/stress-1.0.4.tar.gz

The stress binary is compiled on Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS (32-bit).

After downloading and unpacking the source code, apply a patch to disable the 
hdd stressing, because the CPUstress image does not support writing to disks:

 $ cd stress-1.0.4
 $ patch -p 1 <stress-no-hdd.patch

Then run the configure script and then "make". You will get the binary in the 
"src" directory.

 $ ./configure
 $ make

(Optional) To reduce the file size, I stripped the binary after compilation:

 $ strip ./src/stress

--Explorer <explorer09@gmail.com>
