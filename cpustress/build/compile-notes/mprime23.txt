This Mersenne Prime test v23.9 is the dynamically linked version of the 
official binary.

It can be downloaded from here:
    ftp://www.mersenne.org/gimps_archive/archived_executables/mprime239.tar.gz

After downloading, you can strip the binary file to save a few bytes. I did do 
in my CPUstress image.

 $ mv mprime mprime23
 $ strip mprime23

I also used UPX to compress the executable so the file size could be much 
smaller:
 $ upx mprime23

--Explorer <explorer09@gmail.com>
