This Mersenne Prime test v23.9 is the dynamically linked version of the 
official binary.

It can be downloaded from here:
ftp://www.mersenne.org/gimps_archive/archived_executables/mprime239.tar.gz

After downloading, rename the executable to mprime23:

 $ mv mprime mprime23

(Optional) You can strip the binary file to save a few bytes. I did so in my 
CPUstress image:

 $ strip mprime23

(Optional) I also used UPX to compress the executable so the file size could 
be much smaller:

 $ upx mprime23

(Optional)

 $ chmod 775 mprime27

--Explorer <explorer09@gmail.com>
