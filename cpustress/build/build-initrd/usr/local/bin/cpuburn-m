# Wrapper for CPUburn-in
# ======================
#
# It automatically detects the number of CPUs to stress them all at the same
# time. This requires to run multiple instances of cpuburn-in, because 1
# process can only be executed on 1 CPU.

Run cpuburn-in and stress test for TIME minutes.
If TIME is not specified, run cpuburn-in for 10080 minutes (= 7 days).

To specify how many instances of cpuburn-in will be run, export the 'instances'
shell variable before running this script. e.g. 'export instances=1'
