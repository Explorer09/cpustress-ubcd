Help: wrapper for the Mersenne Prime Torture test (mprime)
==========================================================

This wrapper allows the user to choose which version of mprime he wants to use.
When you run the following in the terminal:
  mprime          ==> will prompt to ask which version should be used
  mprime 23       ==> will run 'Mersenne Prime 23.9.2'
  mprime 27       ==> will run 'Mersenne Prime 27.9 build 1'

When running mprime 23.9.2, the wrapper automaticly detects the number of CPUs
to stress them all at the same time. It will run an instance of 'mprime' for
each CPU in order to heat all CPUs up at the same time. You can do this by
running the background option (-bn with n= number of processes). However, this
option does not display any output on the screen. This can be solved by running
several instances of mprime with the background (&) option of the shell. This
method displays the output of the multiple instances of mprime.

Since version 25.5, a single mprime instance can support multiple CPUs, so the
script won't use the workaround above on mprime 27.9. (This change is made by
Explorer and not Gert Hulselmans.) Note that the background option (-b) is no
longer supported since 25.5.


The following entry will prompt to ask which version of mprime you want to run.

    COM32  linux.c32 /ubcd/boot/cpustress/bzImage
    INITRD /ubcd/boot/cpustress/initrd.gz
    APPEND noapic ubcdcmd=mprime

If you want to run a specific version of mprime, when you boot the image, use:

    COM32  linux.c32 /ubcd/boot/cpustress/bzImage
    INITRD /ubcd/boot/cpustress/initrd.gz
    APPEND noapic ubcdcmd=mprime23

  This will start 'Mersenne Prime 23.9.2'.

    COM32  linux.c32 /ubcd/boot/cpustress/bzImage
    INITRD /ubcd/boot/cpustress/initrd.gz
    APPEND noapic ubcdcmd=mprime27

  This will start 'Mersenne Prime 27.9 build 1'.


This wrapper avoids specifying the working directory part (-w) and the torture
(-t) option of the command 'mprime -t -w/tmp/torture-test/torture.XXXXXX',
so the user can run 'mprime' from a terminal without worrying which parameters
to add to use the torture test of Mersenne Prime Test.
