Help: wrapper for the Mersenne Prime Torture test (mprime)
==========================================================

Written by Gert Hulselmans and Explorer.
Last updated on 7 August 2014.

The mprime wrapper script is made to overcome several design limitations of the
original mprime program and to make a unified command-line interface for use in
the CPUstress image.

The mprime program is from Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS)
project. Their website is here: http://mersenne.org/
Please see the terms and conditions at http://mersenne.org/legal/ when using
the program.

Usage: mprime [VERSION] [OPTIONS...]

The VERSION argument specifies which versions of mprime should be used.
Currently there are two included in CPUstress:
        23 (version 23.9.2)
        27 (version 27.9 build 1)
If VERSION is unspecified, the wrapper will prompt to ask it during execution.

Mersenne Prime v27.9 is a recent version that supports modern processors and
multi-threading. Usually you will choose this version over the old one.
Mersenne Prime v23.9 is a backup version for people who have Pentium III or
older CPUs, since it is said in the changelog that mprime 24.6+ have worse
perfomance on Pertium I, II, or III.

Mprime v23.9 does not support multi-threading like recent versions do, but the
wrapper script will workaround this problem by running multiple instances of
mprime at the same time. It is done using the background option (&) of the
shell, so the output of mprime will be displayed.

The wrapper will present you several options to configure the torture test.
This was a feature available in v25.5+ through the interactive menu, but this
wrapper makes the options available to v23.9 as well.

You may edit the prime.ini or prime.txt file to configure the torture test
manually. Change these variables:
        TortureThreads=    ; Default is to detect automatically.
        MinTortureFFT=8    ; In K
        MaxTortureFFT=4096 ; In K
        TortureMem=8       ; In MiB. Value is per thread.
        TortureTime=15     ; In minutes
If TortureMem is set to 8MiB or less, then the torture test does FFTs in-place.

You may look up the cache sizes of your processor when configuring the torture
test. To do this, bring up mprime's menu ('mprime 27 -m'), and then choose
"Option/CPU".

Environment variable
--------------------

instances=N  Specify the number (N) of touture test threads to run.

Command-line options
--------------------

--noconfig   Skip the touture test configuration.
--tempdir    Always create a temporary working directory (in
             "/tmp/torture-test") when running mprime. This is useful if you
             want to run multiple instances of mprime, each with different
             torture test settings.
-h           Print a help message. If you specify '-h' after a version argument
             (e.g. 'mprime 23 -h'), the help message of that version will be
             displayed. If you invoke just 'mprime -h' without a version, the
             help of the wrapper script will be displayed.
-m           Display mprime's main menu. As the CPUstress image does not have
             Internet connection you cannot connect to PrimeNet. However, you
             may run Advanced tests through the menu. The result of Advanced
             test will be stored in results.txt as usual.
-v           Print the version number of mprime.

The wrapper script might pass additional switches internally to mprime
executable, therefore it is not recommended to specify any of the options
below, or it may conflict with some wrapper script features:

-t           Run the torture test. The wrapper passes this switch internally
             unless when '-m' is specified. If you specify '-t' manually the
             wrapper will disable all of its own features.
-aN          Obsolete. Tells mprime to use a different set of INI and output
             files. N is a 4-digit integer which becomes part of the filenames
             like "prim0012.txt" and "loca0012.txt".
-bN          Mprime 23 only. Run N instances of mprime in the background,
             displaying no output.
-wDIRECTORY  Run from a different working directory.

Specifying either '-a', '-b', or '-w' disables torture test configuration,
temporary directory ('--tempdir'), and can run only single instance of mprime.
The 'instances' variable may also not work.

These three options are useless without PrimeNet and shouldn't be used in
CPUstress: '-c', '-d', and '-s'. Mprime can accept these switches but will have
no effect other than displaying a menu like '-m'.

Running mprime through the isolinux commandline
-----------------------------------------------

The following entry will prompt to ask which version of mprime you want to run.

    COM32  linux.c32 /ubcd/boot/cpustress/bzImage
    INITRD /ubcd/boot/cpustress/initrd.xz
    APPEND noapic ubcdcmd=mprime

If you want to run a specific version of mprime, when you boot the image, use:

    COM32  linux.c32 /ubcd/boot/cpustress/bzImage
    INITRD /ubcd/boot/cpustress/initrd.xz
    APPEND noapic ubcdcmd=mprime23

  This will start 'Mersenne Prime 23.9.2'.

    COM32  linux.c32 /ubcd/boot/cpustress/bzImage
    INITRD /ubcd/boot/cpustress/initrd.xz
    APPEND noapic ubcdcmd=mprime27

  This will start 'Mersenne Prime 27.9 build 1'.

If you want to run mprime with specific parameters, when you boot the image,
use something similar to:

    COM32  linux.c32 /ubcd/boot/cpustress/bzImage
    INITRD /ubcd/boot/cpustress/initrd.xz
    APPEND noapic ubcdcmd=mprime27 instances=2 ubcdargs='--noconfig'

The ubcdargs parameter contains the options that you want to pass to mprime.
The instances parameter may be specified for the number of threads to be run.
Both parameters are optional.

mprime (prime95) package:

                        STRESS TESTING YOUR COMPUTER

BACKGROUND
----------

Today's computers are not perfect.  Even brand new systems from major
manufacturers can have hidden flaws.  If any of several key components such
as CPU, memory, cooling, etc. are not up to spec, it can lead to incorrect
calculations and/or unexplained system crashes.

Overclocking is the practice of increasing the speed of the CPU and/or
memory to make a machine faster at little cost.  Typically, overclocking
involves pushing a machine past its limits and then backing off just a
little bit.

For these reasons, both non-overclockers and overclockers need programs
that test the stability of their computers.  This is done by running
programs that put a heavy load on the computer.  Though not originally
designed for this purpose, this program is one of a few programs that
are excellent at stress testing a computer.


RESOURCES
---------

This program is a good stress test for the CPU, memory, L1 and L2 caches,
CPU cooling, and case cooling.  The torture test runs continuously, comparing
your computer's results to results that are known to be correct.  Any
mismatch and you've got a problem!  Note that the torture test sometimes
reads from and writes to disk but cannot be considered a stress test for
hard drives.

You'll need other programs to stress video cards, PCI bus, disk access,
networking and other important components.  In addition, this is only one
of several good programs that are freely available.  Some people report
finding problems only when running two or more stress test programs
concurrently.  You may need to raise prime95's priority when running two
stress test programs so that each gets about 50% of the CPU time.

Forums are a great place to learn about available stability test programs
and to get advice on what to do when a problem is found.

The currently popular stability test programs are (sorry, I don't have
web addresses for these):
        Prime95 (this program's torture test)
        3DMark2001
        CPU Stability test
        Sisoft sandra
        Quake and other games
        Folding@Home
        Seti@home
        Genome@home

WHAT TO DO IF A PROBLEM IS FOUND?
---------------------------------

The exact cause of a hardware problem can be very hard to find.

If you are not overclocking, the most likely cause is an overheating CPU
or memory DIMMs that are not quite up to spec.  Another possibility is
you might need a better power supply.  Try running MotherBoard monitor
and browse the forums above to see if your CPU is running too hot.
If so, make sure the heat sink is properly attached, fans are operational,
and air flow inside the case is good.  For isolating memory problems, try
swapping memory DIMMs with a co-worker's or friend's machine.  If the errors
go away, then you can be fairly confidant that memory was the cause of
the trouble.  A power supply problem can often be identified by a significant
drop in the voltages when prime95 starts running.  Once again the overclocker
forums are a good resource for what voltages are acceptable.

If you are overclocking then try increasing the core voltage, reduce the
CPU speed, reduce the front side bus speed, or change the memory timings
(CAS latency).  Also try asking for help in one of the forums above - they
may have other ideas to try.


CAN I IGNORE THE PROBLEM?
-------------------------

Ignoring the problem is a matter of personal preference.  There are
two schools of thought on this subject.

Most programs you run will not stress your computer enough to cause a
wrong result or system crash.  If you ignore the problem, then video games
may stress your machine resulting in a system crash.  Also, stay away from
distributed computing projects where an incorrect calculation might cause
you to return wrong results.  Bad data will not help these projects!
In conclusion, if you are comfortable with a small risk of an occasional
system crash then feel free to live a little dangerously!  Keep in mind
that the faster prime95 finds a hardware error the more likely it is that
other programs will experience problems.

The second school of thought is, "Why run a stress test if you are going
to ignore the results?"  These people want a guaranteed 100% rock solid
machine.  Passing these stability tests gives them the ability to run
CPU intensive programs with confidence.


FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
--------------------------

Q)  My machine is not overclocked.  If I'm getting an error, then there must
be a bug in the program, right?

        A)  The torture test is comparing your machines results against
        KNOWN CORRECT RESULTS.  If your machine cannot generate correct
        results, you have a hardware problem.  HOWEVER, if you are failing
        the torture test in the SAME SPOT with the SAME ERROR MESSAGE
        every time, then ask for help at http://mersenneforum.org - it is
        possible that a recent change to the torture test code may have
        introduced a software bug.

Q)  How long should I run the torture test?

        A)  I recommend running it for somewhere between 6 and 24 hours.
        The program has been known to fail only after several hours and in
        some cases several weeks of operation.  In most cases though, it will
        fail within a few minutes on a flaky machine.

Q)  Prime95 reports errors during the torture test, but other stability
tests don't.  Do I have a problem?

        A)  Yes, you've reached the point where your machine has been
        pushed just beyond its limits.  Follow the recommendations above
        to make your machine 100% stable or decide to live with a
        machine that could have problems in rare circumstances.

Q)  A forum member said "Don't bother with prime95, it always pukes on me,
and my system is stable!.  What do you make of that?"

        or

"We had a server at work that ran for 2 MONTHS straight, without a reboot
I installed Prime95 on it and ran it - a couple minutes later I get an error.
You are going to tell me that the server wasn't stable?"

        A)  These users obviously do not subscribe to the 100% rock solid
        school of thought.  THEIR MACHINES DO HAVE HARDWARE PROBLEMS.
        But since they are not presently running any programs that reveal
        the hardware problem, the machines are quite stable.  As long as
        these machines never run a program that uncovers the hardware problem,
        then the machines will continue to be stable.
