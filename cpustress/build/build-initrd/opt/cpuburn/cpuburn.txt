CPU Burn-in README

What is CPU Burn-in?
-------------------

CPU Burn-in v1.0 by Michal Mienik is the ultimate stability testing tool for
overclockers. The program heats up any x86 CPU to the maximum possible
operating temperature that is achievable by using ordinary software.
This allows the user to adjust the CPU speed up to the practical maximum while
still being sure that stability is achieved even under the most stressful
conditions. The program continuously monitors for erroneous calculations
ensuring the CPU does not generate errors during calculations.

Note from Gert Hulselmans: 'cpuburn' is a wrapper that automaticly detects the
number of CPUs so they can be stressed all at the same time. It will run an
instance of 'cpuburn-in' for each CPU in order to heat all CPUs up at the same
time.

Why use CPU Burn-in?
-------------------

In the past overclocking stability was tested by running intensive software
such as Distributed.Net clients or SETI@home.  Running either piece of software
for 24 hours would generally show up instability. A looping Quake3 timedemo was
also a good choice.

However, there are inherent limitations in these tests:

Not every error caused by overclocking causes a program to crash or the system
to hang. Some errors may be more subtle, such as a slight miscalculation. If
such an event occurs and causes a pixel to render a slightly different colour
in Quake3 for example, the user is unlikely to notice and overall this is no
big deal. However such small errors can have a potentially devastating on
distributed projects such as SETI@home, which rely on the reliable processing
of data.

CPU Burn-in consistently delivers a higher CPU operating temperature than the
above mentioned  applications.  This allows CPU Burn-in to be particularly
effective at testing overclocking stability and cooling effectiveness.

How does it work?
----------------

CPU Burn-in constantly cycles FPU intensive functions for a user specified
period of time. The resultant calculations are constantly checked for data
integrity.  If the program detects erroneous data the user is immediately
informed.  Applications such as SETI@home and Distributed.Net perform no such
data checking.  The user must rely on those programs to crash or the system to
hang before a problem can be noticed.

Instructions:
------------

Please Note: Overclocking can potentially be harmful to your CPU.  It may fry
or fail prematurely in the long term.  I cannot and will not be responsible for
 any damage you do to your hardware. By it's very nature, CPU Burn-in pushes
the CPU to the max.  Increasing the voltage, Mhz, or PCI/AGP above the
recommended levels can cause damage.

CPU Burn-in runs best as a high priority process on an otherwise idle system.



Run the program with one command line value to specify the length of time to
run the test:

eg.
   "cpuburn 10"    will run the test for ten minutes.


If you want to run cpuburn-in for a certain time, you can also add a parameter
to the isolinux config file:

eg. Run cpuburn-in for 10 days.

     COM32  linux.c32 /ubcd/boot/cpustress/bzImage
     INITRD /ubcd/boot/cpustress/initrd.gz
     APPEND root=/dev/ram0 ramdisk_size=12000 noapic ubcdcmd=cpuburn days=10


eg. Run cpuburn-in for 10 hours.

     COM32  linux.c32 /ubcd/boot/cpustress/bzImage
     INITRD /ubcd/boot/cpustress/initrd.gz
     APPEND root=/dev/ram0 ramdisk_size=12000 noapic ubcdcmd=cpuburn hours=10


eg. Run cpuburn-in for 10 minutes.

     COM32  linux.c32 /ubcd/boot/cpustress/bzImage
     INITRD /ubcd/boot/cpustress/initrd.gz
     APPEND root=/dev/ram0 ramdisk_size=12000 noapic ubcdcmd=cpuburn minutes=10


If those parameters are all provided to the APPEND command of the isolinux
config, the run time will be determined by the first value of the time duration
which will be searched in the following order: days > hours > minutes.
So if 'minutes=100000000' and 'days=10' is found, the run time will be set to
14400 minutes (= 10 days).


If cpuburn is called without parameters, it will run cpuburn-in for 10080
minutes (= 7 days).

If your system experiences instability during the burn-in test or you receive
error messages it's likely the system has been overclocked too far.
