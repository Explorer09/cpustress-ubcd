Please don't put any files inside this directory. They will be DELETED when 
building the ISO image.

The make_iso.sh script will temporarily copy the contents from the cpustress 
directory (at the top of the repo) to here. Then this directory will be 
cleaned up again, leaving only this NOTICE.txt.
