title CPUstress development\n A minimal Linux boot image that is used to run several stress-testing tools on\n the UBCD. This entry will launch the internal menu, in which you can select\n which stress program to run.

title CPUburn V1.4a\n CPU testing utilities in optimized assembler for maximum loading P6 (Intel\n Pentium Pro/II/III and Celeron TM), AMD K7 (Athlon/Duron/Thunderbird TM) AMD\n K6, and Intel P5 Pentium chips.

title CPU Burn-in V1.00\n Heats up any x86 CPU to the maximum possible operating temperature that is\n achievable by using ordinary software. This allows the user to adjust the CPU\n speed up to the practical maximum while still being sure that stability is\n achieved even under the most stressful conditions.

title CPUinfo\n Gives info about your CPU: number of processors, vendor, CPU family, CPU model\n name, CPU speed, cache size, possible construction bugs of your cpu, which\n extensions (flags) your CPU supports.

title Intel Optimized LINPACK Benchmark V11.1.2\n A generalization of the LINPACK 1000 benchmark. Solves a dense (real*8) system\n of linear equations (Ax=b), measures the amount of time it takes to factor and\n solve the system, converts that time into a performance rate, and tests the\n results for accuracy.

title Stress V1.04\n Simple workload generator for POSIX systems. It imposes a configurable amount\n of CPU, memory, I/O, and disk stress on the system. This menu item launches\n stress with the "--help" parameter that displays all possible options. You\n need to run it again with the stress test options that you prefer.

title StressCPU V2.0 (requires CPU with SSE)\n Torture-test your CPU in order to make sure that you don't have overheating\n problems. Requires SSE-equipped x86 CPUs. Executes a special version of the\n Gromacs innerloops that mixes SSE and normal assembly instructions to heat\n your CPU as much as possible.
kernel /ubcd/boot/cpustress/bzImage noapic quiet ubcdcmd=stresscpu2

title System Stability Tester V1.5.1\n Test the system's stability by calculating up to 128 millions of Pi digits.\n Supports two calculation algorithms: The Quadratic Convergence of Borwein and\n Gauss-Legendre. Can create up to 64 threads. The calculation results of all\n the threads are compared after each step.
