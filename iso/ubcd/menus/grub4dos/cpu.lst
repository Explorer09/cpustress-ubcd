title CPUstress development\n A minimal Linux boot image that is used to run several stress-testing tools on\n the UBCD. This entry launches the internal menu, in which you can select which\n stress program to run.

title CPUburn V1.4a\n Included in CPUstress. CPU testing utilities in optimized assembler for\n maximum loading P6 (Intel Pentium Pro/II/III and Celeron), AMD K7 (Athlon/\n Duron/Thunderbird), AMD K6, and Intel P5 Pentium chips.

title CPU Burn-in V1.00\n Included in CPUstress. Heats up any x86 CPU to the maximum possible operating\n temperature that is achievable by using ordinary software. This allows the\n user to adjust the CPU speed up to the practical maximum while still being\n sure that stability is achieved even under the most stressful conditions.

title CPUinfo\n Included in CPUstress. Gives info about your CPU: number of processors,\n vendor, CPU family, CPU model name, CPU speed, cache size, possible\n construction bugs of your cpu, which extensions (flags) your CPU supports.

title Intel Optimized LINPACK Benchmark V11.2.0\n Included in CPUstress. A generalization of the LINPACK 1000 benchmark. Solves\n a dense (real*8) system of linear equations (Ax=b), measures the amount of\n time it takes to factor and solve the system, converts that time into a\n performance rate, and tests the results for accuracy.

title Mersenne Prime Test V28.5\n Included in CPUstress. Mersenne Prime Search program that stresses the CPU.

title Stress V1.04\n Included in CPUstress. Workload generator for POSIX systems. Imposes a\n configurable amount of CPU, memory, and I/O stress on the system. This entry\n launches stress with the "--help" parameter that displays all possible\n options. You need to run it again with the test options that you prefer.

title StressCPU V2.0 (requires CPU with SSE)\n Included in CPUstress. Torture-test your CPU in order to make sure that you\n don't have overheating problems. Requires SSE-equipped x86 CPUs. Executes\n special version of the Gromacs innerloops that mixes SSE and normal assembly\n instructions to heat your CPU as much as possible.
kernel /ubcd/boot/cpustress/bzImage noapic quiet consoleblank=0 ubcdcmd=stresscpu2

title System Stability Tester V1.5.1\n Included in CPUstress. Tests the system's stability by calculating up to 128\n millions of Pi digits. Supports two calculation algorithms: The Quadratic\n Convergence of Borwein and Gauss-Legendre. This entry starts the default test\n (QCBorwein 128K digits). You may run it again for other test options.
