title CPU Burn-in V1.00\n Heats up any x86 CPU to the maximum possible operating temperature that is\n achievable by using ordinary software. This allows the user to adjust the CPU\n speed up to the practical maximum while still being sure that stability is\n achieved even under the most stressful conditions.

title CPUinfo\n Gives info about your CPU: number of processors, vendor, CPU family, CPU model\n name, CPU speed, cache size, possible construction bugs of your cpu, which\n extensions (flags) your CPU supports.

title Stress V1.04\n Simple workload generator for POSIX systems. It imposes a configurable amount\n of CPU, memory, I/O, and disk stress on the system. This menu item launches\n stress with the "--help" parameter that displays all possible options. You\n need to run it again with the stress test options that you prefer.

title StressCPU V2.0 (requires CPU with SSE)\n Torture-test your CPU in order to make sure that you don't have overheating\n problems. Requires SSE-equipped x86 CPUs. Executes a special version of the\n Gromacs innerloops that mixes SSE and normal assembly instructions to heat\n your CPU as much as possible.
