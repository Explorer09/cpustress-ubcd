MENU LABEL CPU Burn-in V1.00
TEXT HELP
 Heats up any x86 CPU to the maximum possible operating temperature that is
 achievable by using ordinary software. This allows the user to adjust the CPU
 speed up to the practical maximum while still being sure that stability is
 achieved even under the most stressful conditions.

MENU LABEL Intel Optimized LINPACK Benchmark V11.1.3
TEXT HELP
 A generalization of the LINPACK 1000 benchmark. Solves a dense (real*8) system
 of linear equations (Ax=b), measures the amount of time it takes to factor and
 solve the system, converts that time into a performance rate, and tests the
 results for accuracy.
