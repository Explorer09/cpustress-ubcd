MENU LABEL CPU Burn-in V1.00
TEXT HELP
 Included in CPUstress. Heats up any x86 CPU to the maximum possible operating
 temperature that is achievable by using ordinary software. This allows the
 user to adjust the CPU speed up to the practical maximum while still being
 sure that stability is achieved even under the most stressful conditions.

MENU LABEL Intel Optimized LINPACK Benchmark V11.2.0
TEXT HELP
 Included in CPUstress. A generalization of the LINPACK 1000 benchmark. Solves
 a dense (real*8) system of linear equations (Ax=b), measures the amount of
 time it takes to factor and solve the system, converts that time into a
 performance rate, and tests the results for accuracy.

TEXT HELP
 Included in CPUstress. Workload generator for POSIX systems. Imposes a
 configurable amount of CPU, memory, and I/O stress on the system. This entry
 launches stress with the "--help" parameter that displays all possible
 options. You need to run it again with the test options that you prefer.

TEXT HELP
 Included in CPUstress. Torture-test your CPU in order to make sure that you
 don't have overheating problems. Requires SSE-equipped x86 CPUs. Executes a
 special version of the Gromacs innerloops that mixes SSE and normal assembly
 instructions to heat your CPU as much as possible.
